## Objective
Implement a basic AI using the Minimax algorithm to play against the user.

## Steps
1. Research and understand the Minimax algorithm.
2. Define a method to evaluate the board state.
3. Implement the Minimax algorithm to generate the best move for the AI.
4. Integrate the AI with the board representation, move validation, and move generation logic.
5. Write unit tests to verify the correctness of the AI.
