## Objective
Optimize the performance of the chess engine to improve its speed and efficiency.

## Steps
1. Profile the current performance of the chess engine to identify bottlenecks.
2. Optimize the board representation and move generation logic.
3. Implement caching or memoization techniques to avoid redundant calculations.
4. Optimize the AI algorithm to reduce its computational complexity.
5. Write performance tests to verify the improvements.
